# discounting-tp
PsychoPy task array including temporal discounting and two different time perception tasks 

This repository includes the PsychoPy (.psyexp), Python, and Javascript (for use on Pavlovia) files for an array of behavioral tasks
Includes a temporal discounting task loosely based off of McClure (2004) and Decker & Figner (2015) temporal discounting studies. 

Also includes two different time perception/time estimation tasks: 
The first is a replication of Volle (2011) which asks participants to count in their heads at a certain pace up to a given number. 
The second time estimation task a modified version of the task used in Zauberman (2009) and involves 
asking participants to judge their perception of the duration of different time intervals,
ranging from 2 weeks - 10 years.
